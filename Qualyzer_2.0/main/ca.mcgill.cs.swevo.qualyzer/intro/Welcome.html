<h1>Welcome to Qualyzer!</h1>

<p>We're happy you decided to give us a try.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2> 

<p>You must first create a project. Choose <code>File | New ->
Project</code> from the main menu (at the very top left of this window).
Fill in the dialog box with
information about you and your project (go ahead and do this
now). When you click "Finish", a <strong>project structure</strong> is created (you'll see
this as soon as you close this page).</p>

<p>You interact with Qualyzer by
right-clicking on the icons in the project structure, and choosing
your desired actions.</p>
